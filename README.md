# ballistic.calculator.app.old

The old (2015) version of a ballistic calculator for Windows and Android. 

A new version is currently under development:

* [A library: pre-release](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/BallisticCalculator1)
* [A windows application: ALPHA](https://github.com/nikolaygekht/ballistic.calculator.app)

This version is compatible with WinE, [follow the instructions](https://github.com/nikolaygekht/ballistic.calculator.app/wiki/How-to-run-application-on-Linux-using-Wine) in new application repo, just use [.NET 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6041) 
framework or mono instead of .NET 6.0.

## RISK NOTICE

The application performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
